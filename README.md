# BITBusConfig

A hopefully small repo as an attempt to modernlize how (the legacy) BITBus WeChat Mini Program's config is maintained.

Built with NodeJS, TypeScript, Jest.

Believe it or not, previously it was a process of handcrafting JSON with some helper JavaScript snippet.

## Commands

- `npm run build` generate compliant JSON in `build` folder
- (TODO) `npm run deploy` deploy updated JSON to Tencent Cloud for WeChat Mini Program
- `npm test` run test suite of the scripts
